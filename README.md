the game let the sheep to eat the food coming down form the top of the screen.

if the sheep gets the plum successfully, your marks increase by 3, otherwise it reduces by 1.
if the sheep gets the orange successfully, your marks increase by 2, otherwise it reduces by 2.

if the total mark is below 0, or the sheep eats the bomb, the game will be over.

the fallen speed of the plum and the orange will be faster as the increase of time you play.

good luck and have fun!
